Extra notes from Paolo:
Hiya, I'm Paolo.  I wrote this initially for myself, but thought I'd put it on github in hopes that it would help you out a bit.  That said, code may be sloppy and have bad style, but at the end of the day, it's all about building a product!

Please use this for good and not for evil.  Please do not be a douchebag.
