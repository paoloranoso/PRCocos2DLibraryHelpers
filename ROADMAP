This is a very free-form TODO list/brainstorming scratch sheet, so don't take it too seriously:

TODO:
-add parent header to import all helper classes (e.g: like how #import "cocos2d.h" imports all)
-animation manager/helpers???
-isometric/orthogonal helpers?
-try thinking about stuff you end up typing a lot and make convenience classes out of those
-maybe add non-cocos stuff in here that I usually use?  e.g: MckHelpers/MCKHttpClient/MckConfig???
-blocks/notification stuff?
