This is a very free-form TODO list/brainstorming scratch sheet, so don't take it too seriously:

TODO:

-create generic game object(pg. 132) or maybe a character class that has stuff like:
	-sprite
	-animationsList loaded by plist?(?? would this be too much if we created a lot of these game objects?)	
		-may want to read more so that we can see the animation helper category?
	-registers with touch dispatcher
		-possible init's could be with single or multiple
	-
	
-add parent header to import all helper classes (e.g: like how #import "cocos2d.h" imports all)
-animation manager/helpers???
-isometric/orthogonal helpers?
-try thinking about stuff you end up typing a lot and make convenience classes out of those
-maybe add non-cocos stuff in here that I usually use?  e.g: MckHelpers/MCKHttpClient/MckConfig???
-blocks/notification stuff?
